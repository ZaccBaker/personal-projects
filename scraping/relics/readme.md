### About
A web scrapping program that gets the entire list of relics from Warframe's wiki. Fast and reliable way to get and format to a json file.

### Lessons learned
This was my first attempt at creating a web scraping program. I wanted to be able to get all of the relics from the official Warframe website. I had a hard time iterating through the HTML objects and finding the right ones. The next challenge was being able to sort them corrently. Since the names consist of a letter and a number, this meant that Python sorted them alphabetically automatically. Since I wanted them to be sorted alphabetically AND numerically I had to find a method to do this. 

### Languages
Python
