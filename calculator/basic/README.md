## About
A basic calculator using JavaFX and FXML. I wanted to implement this and get closer to the MVC architecture. Once I learned about the separation of logic from back-end and front-end, I wanted to test it out. My overall goal was to complete a basic project to get more accustomed to Java. Sortly after starting, I learned about FXML and knew I needed to restart the project with it.

## Lessons Learned
- Introduction into FXML and a proper controller class
- Becoming more familiar with JavaFX CSS syntax
- Starting to understand the MVC architecture and the separation of logic roles
